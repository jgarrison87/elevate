    <p class="sm">
      Whether you have tried other “side gigs” or not.  Trust us when we say WE ARE DIFFERENT.  For starters, from corporate leaders down to every single person on our team – WE CARE.  We want you to achieve YOUR goals and so much more!  You will not find a more caring and supportive group of people to work and do life with! 
      <br>
      <br>
      Secondly, when our founders created this company, they had 50+ years of experience in the network marketing industry so they KNEW what worked and what did not work.  They knew exactly how they wanted the compensation plan to work and their main goal was to make it achievable for the average person.  That is why our compensation plan has no hoops or loops to jump through, no crazy requirements that will drive you to burnout.  Just a simple way of sharing and getting paid to do so.

        You are probably thinking to yourself, “yea, but HOW”.  Well, we have tools and resources to help and your team leaders will be right there with you every step of the way.  Really, we will!  We get more joy out of helping you crush your goals than we do crushing our own.  True story.

We already touched on it but it is so important, it deserves to be mentioned again.  Your founders created this compensation plan for you.  So you don’t have any prior network marketing experience, who cares?!  What matters is you found a product line that you love and that WORKS.  Now you just have to share it with others, connect them to your team leaders and invite them to give it a try. 
<br>
<br>
Many other companies have luxury car programs (aka programs requiring you to maintain certain sales quotas to continue earning that bonus otherwise you pay for it out of your own pocket) and complicated bonus pools.  We do 2 simple things:  We pay you in cash, DAILY, and we pay you in trips.  Oh and we pay for a loved one to go on these trips with you; yup, ALL EXPENSE PAID FOR TWO, including airfare!   
<br>
<br>
Oh and did I mention that ALL levels and ranks earn a bonus EACH month from what we call the Profit Sharing Bonus Pool?  Yup, you read that right – EVERY SINGLE RANK.  You don’t have to wait till you hit the upper ranks to be earning bonuses, you earn one from the very first rank.  Did we mention that our company built this compensation plan FOR YOU?   
<br>
<br>
So if you want to build a stream of income on your OWN TIME, from wherever you want, without any hoops to jump through, sales quotas to hit or inventory to carry – it's time we talk.  Join us!
